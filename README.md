This is a backend + (sample) frontend Voice-to-Voice Banking Assistant project. 
With this application, users can communicate with their transaction records through an AI Agent. 

- Users connect to the backend via a websocket with FastAPI
- Groq API is used for Speech-to-Text conversion
- Text generation is done through a PydanticAI Agent 
- The Agent currently can perform the following functionalities:
    - Retrieve last n transactions based on optional filters for start date, end date, category, and merchant.
    - Providing a spendings summary for a given time period by category.
    - Identifying transactions that deviate from past behavior.
- Text-to-Speech is done through OpenAI's TTS models.
- The application uses a PostgreSQL database (running on Docker) to store and retrieve conversation history. 
- The user transaction database is a sqlite3 databse with sample transactions, from Kaggle.
- There is a UI with React that allows user communication with the server, and also shows chat history on the side. 
- Pydantic Logfire is used for real-time and historic observability of interactions with the server.

### Frontend

Shows the sample UI. On the side users can optionally see the conversation history.

### Observability

We can see real-time connections with logs, traces and calls.

Also we can setup a dashboard, alerts, and query the logs/traces database.

I have been looking to upgrade upon my previous [finance assistant](https://github.com/divakaivan/personal_finance_assistant) project for a while. I am glad I found [this](https://substack.com/home/post/p-155677310) article which introduced me to more advanced usage of FastAPI and also PydanticAI. This upgraded version focuses primarily on server development, interactions through a websocket, incorporating asynchronous operations for improved responsiveness, type checking for better reliability, and AI Agents to interact with the customer transaction database.
